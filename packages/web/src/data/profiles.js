      summary: "I'm a Full Stack Engineer with experience in QA automation and Node.js development. I've led teams in frontend development and QA engineering, working on testing frameworks, automation, and fullstack applications across various R&D projects. My work includes building automated testing tools with Python and developing web platforms with Node.js, Vue, and WebGL.\n\nI work well with cross-functional teams and enjoy the collaborative aspects of software development. Being fluent in both Spanish and English helps me communicate effectively across different teams and projects. I've had the opportunity to lead projects and work with other developers, focusing on practical solutions that balance quality with delivery timelines.\n\nMy technical background covers testing frameworks, AWS infrastructure, and a range of development work from AR/VR to web platforms. I try to bring the structured approach from QA work into fullstack development, building systems that are functional and maintainable without overcomplicating things.\n\nAnd always show a smile"
